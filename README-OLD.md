# Engine Generator

## This script is garbage
I am releasing this script **as is** and I have no intention of actively maintaining or updating it. I wrote it just to experiment with huge engines and save myself some work for a YouTube video. A lot of you asked for it to be released so here it is. If you'd like to make modifications to the script, feel free to make a pull request.

## How to use the script
### Running the script
1. Install Python 3 on your computer if it isn't already installed
2. Open a terminal and run `py engine.py`

### Modifying parameters
All engine parameters are specified in the `Engine` class. Understanding how this works will require some knowledge of programming and there isn't a specific procedure to follow. The best way to understand how the script to work is to analyze the `generate_i4()`, `generate_v24()` and `generate_v69()` functions located in the `engine.py` script. It should be clear how the script works from these examples.
